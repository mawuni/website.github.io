## Welcome!

I am a PhD Candidate in Finance at Stevens Institute of Technology. My research studies how **financing, regulation, and market structure shape entrepreneurial outcomes**, with a particular focus on **venture capital, firm dynamics, and the distribution of startup growth and failure**.

I am especially interested in settings where **policy or institutional changes alter incentives for founders, investors, and workers**, and in understanding how these changes affect **entry, exit, growth trajectories, and risk-taking** among young firms.

Much of my work uses **large-scale U.S. administrative data** (e.g., Census BDS, SUSB, Nonemployer Statistics) combined with **quasi-experimental and structural methods**.
